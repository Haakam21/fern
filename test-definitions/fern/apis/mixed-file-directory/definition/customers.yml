        Lists customer profiles associated with a Square account.


        Under normal operating conditions, newly created or updated customer
        profiles become available

        for the listing operation in well under 30 seconds. Occasionally,
        propagation of the new or updated

        profiles can take closer to one minute or longer, especially during
        network incidents and outages.

        Creates or updates [custom attributes](entity:CustomAttribute) for
        customer profiles as a bulk operation.


        Use this endpoint to set the value of one or more custom attributes for
        one or more customer profiles.

        A custom attribute is based on a custom attribute definition in a Square
        seller account, which is

        created using the
        [CreateCustomerCustomAttributeDefinition](api-endpoint:CustomerCustomAttributes-CreateCustomerCustomAttributeDefinition)
        endpoint.


        This `BulkUpsertCustomerCustomAttributes` endpoint accepts a map of 1 to
        25 individual upsert 

        requests and returns a map of individual upsert responses. Each upsert
        request has a unique ID 

        and provides a customer ID and custom attribute. Each upsert response is
        returned with the ID 

        of the corresponding request.


        To create or update a custom attribute owned by another application, the
        `visibility` setting

        must be `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES`. Note that seller-defined custom
        attributes

        (also known as custom fields) are always set to
        `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES`.

        Searches the customer profiles associated with a Square account using
        one or more supported query filters.


        Calling `SearchCustomers` without any explicit query filter returns all

        customer profiles ordered alphabetically based on `given_name` and

        `family_name`.


        Under normal operating conditions, newly created or updated customer
        profiles become available

        for the search operation in well under 30 seconds. Occasionally,
        propagation of the new or updated

        profiles can take closer to one minute or longer, especially during
        network incidents and outages.

      docs: >-
        Deletes a customer profile from a business. This operation also unlinks
        any associated cards on file. 


        As a best practice, you should include the `version` field in the
        request to enable [optimistic
        concurrency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/optimistic-concurrency)
        control. The value must be set to the current version of the customer
        profile. 


        To delete a customer profile that was created by merging existing
        profiles, you must use the ID of the newly created profile.
