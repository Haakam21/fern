          If this field is not set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, Square
          populates it after the buyer's first action on their account 

          (when `AccumulateLoyaltyPoints` or `CreateLoyaltyReward` is called).

          This field is typically specified in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request
          when creating a loyalty account for a buyer who already interacted
          with their account. 

          For example, you would set this field when migrating accounts from an

          Kingdom, and United States, tipping options are presented as no tip,
          .50, 1.00 or 2.00.

  V1Tender:
    docs: >-
      A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this

      exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the

      amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.


      Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment
      (such

      as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The
      `tender`

      field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the
      payment.


      Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender
      payments:


      The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender
      listed

      in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders,
      use

      the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.


      *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from
      a

      merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the

      associated payment.


      When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is

      reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type
      of

      `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the

      associated payment.

          Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some
          circumstances taxes must

          be calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular
          discount. For example,

          in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate
          reduces the price a

          customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how
          much sales tax is

          due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon
          should have

          `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.

  CatalogItemVariation:
    docs: >-
      An item variation, representing a product for sale, in the Catalog object
      model. Each [item](entity:CatalogItem) must have at least one 

      item variation and can have at most 250 item variations. 


      An item variation can be sellable, stockable, or both if it has a unit of
      measure for its count for the sold number of the variation, the stocked 

      number of the variation, or both. For example, when a variation
      representing wine is stocked and sold by the bottle, the variation is
      both 

      stockable and sellable. But when a variation of the wine is sold by the
      glass, the sold units cannot be used as a measure of the stocked units.
      This by-the-glass 

      variation is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the
      wine's inventory count at any time, the sellable count must be 

      converted to stockable count. Typically, the seller defines this unit
      conversion. For example, 1 bottle equals 5 glasses. The Square API
      exposes 

      the `stockable_conversion` property on the variation to specify the
      conversion. Thus, when two glasses of the wine are sold, the sellable
      count 

      decreases by 2, and the stockable count automatically decreases by 0.4
      bottle according to the conversion.

  CatalogObject:
    docs: >-
      The wrapper object for the catalog entries of a given object type.


      Depending on the `type` attribute value, a `CatalogObject` instance
      assumes a type-specific data to yield the corresponding type of catalog
      object.


      For example, if `type=ITEM`, the `CatalogObject` instance must have the
      ITEM-specific data set on the `item_data` attribute. The resulting
      `CatalogObject` instance is also a `CatalogItem` instance.


      In general, if `type=<OBJECT_TYPE>`, the `CatalogObject` instance must
      have the `<OBJECT_TYPE>`-specific data set on the `<object_type>_data`
      attribute. The resulting `CatalogObject` instance is also a
      `Catalog<ObjectType>` instance.

          value defined in the associated

          `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed
          by

          the defining application ID. For example, if the
          `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of

          `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the
          key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`

          if the application making the request is different from the
          application defining the custom attribute definition.

          Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.


          Application-defined custom attributes are set at a global
          (location-independent) level.

          Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information
          about a catalog object

          or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom

      of a customer-related [custom attribute](entity:CustomAttribute).
    properties:
      email:
        type: optional<CustomerTextFilter>
        docs: >-
          A filter for a query based on the value of an `Email`-type custom
          attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and can

          include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.


          For an `exact` match, provide the complete email address.


          For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more
          query tokens to match against the email address. Square removes

          any punctuation (including periods (.), underscores (_), and the @
          symbol) and tokenizes the email addresses on spaces. A match is found

          if a tokenized email address contains all the tokens in the search
          query, irrespective of the token order. For example, `Steven gmail`

          matches steven.jones@gmail.com and mygmail@stevensbakery.com.
      phone:
        type: optional<CustomerTextFilter>
        docs: >-
          A filter for a query based on the value of a `PhoneNumber`-type custom
          attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and

          can include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.


          For an `exact` match, provide the complete phone number. This is
          always an E.164-compliant phone number that starts

          with the + sign followed by the country code and subscriber number.
          For example, the format for a US phone number is +12061112222.


          For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more
          query tokens to match against the phone number.

          Square removes any punctuation and tokenizes the expression on spaces.
          A match is found if a tokenized phone number contains

          all the tokens in the search query, irrespective of the token order.
          For example, `415 123 45` is tokenized to `415`, `123`, and `45`,

          which matches +14151234567 and +12345674158, but does not match
          +1234156780. Similarly, the expression `415` matches

          +14151234567, +12345674158, and +1234156780.
      text:
        type: optional<CustomerTextFilter>
        docs: >-
          A filter for a query based on the value of a `String`-type custom
          attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and 

          can include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.


          For an `exact` match, provide the complete string.


          For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more
          query tokens in any order that contain complete words

          to match against the string. Square tokenizes the expression using a
          grammar-based tokenizer. For example, the expressions `quick brown`,

          `brown quick`, and `quick fox` match "The quick brown fox jumps over
          the lazy dog". However, `quick foxes` and `qui` do not match.
      selection:
        type: optional<FilterValue>
        docs: >-
          A filter for a query based on the display name for a `Selection`-type
          custom attribute value. This filter is case-sensitive

          and can contain `any`, `all`, or both. The `none` condition is not
          supported.


          Provide the display name of each item that you want to search for. To
          find the display names for the selection, use the 

          [Customer Custom Attributes API](api:CustomerCustomAttributes) to
          retrieve the corresponding custom attribute definition

          and then check the `schema.items.names` field. For more information,

          [Search based on
          selection](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#custom-attribute-value-filter-selection).


          Note that when a `Selection`-type custom attribute is assigned to a
          customer profile, the custom attribute value is a list of one

          or more UUIDs (sourced from the `schema.items.enum` field) that map to
          the item names. These UUIDs are unique per seller.
      date:

        docs: >-
          A filter for a query based on the value of a `Date`-type custom
          attribute.


          Provide a date range for this filter using `start_at`, `end_at`, or
          both. Range boundaries are inclusive. Dates can be specified

          in `YYYY-MM-DD` format or as RFC 3339 timestamps.
      number:
        type: optional<FloatNumberRange>
        docs: >-

          5 digits of precision.


          Provide a numerical range for this filter using `start_at`, `end_at`,
          or both. Range boundaries are inclusive. Numbers are specified

          as decimals or integers. The absolute value of range boundaries must
          not exceed `(2^63-1)/10^5`, or 92233720368547.
      boolean:
        type: optional<boolean>

          This filter is case-insensitive.


          For [exact
          matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#exact-search-by-email-address),
          this

          filter causes the search to return customer profiles 

          whose `email_address` field value are identical to the email address
          provided

          in the query.


          For [fuzzy
          matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#fuzzy-search-by-email-address), 

          this filter causes the search to return customer profiles 

          whose `email_address` field value has a token-wise partial match
          against the filtering 

          expression in the query. For example, with `Steven gmail` provided in
          a search

          query, the search returns customers whose email address is
          `steven.johnson@gmail.com` 

          or `mygmail@stevensbakery.com`. Square removes any punctuation
          (including periods (.),

          underscores (_), and the @ symbol) and tokenizes the email addresses
          on spaces. A match is

          found if a tokenized email address contains all the tokens in the
          search query, 

          irrespective of the token order.
      phone_number:

          For [exact
          matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#exact-search-by-phone-number), 

          this filter causes the search to return customers whose phone number

          matches the specified query expression. The number in the query must
          be of an E.164-compliant

          form. In particular, it must include the leading `+` sign followed by
          a country code and then a

          subscriber number. The standard E.614 form of a US phone number is
          `+12061112222` of

          the domestic version or `+0012061112222` of the international version.
          The E.164-compliant

          variations include `+1 (206) 111-2222` or `+001 (206) 111-2222`,
          respectively. To match

          the query expression, stored customer phone numbers are converted to
          the standard

          E.164 form of the national and internationalized versions.



          For [fuzzy
          matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#fuzzy-search-by-phone-number), 

          this filter causes the search to return customers whose phone number
          matches partially 

          the token or tokens provided in the query expression. For example,
          with `415` provided in a search query,

          the search returns customers with the phone numbers `+1-415-212-1200`,
          `+1-212-415-1234`, and `+1 (551) 234-1567`.

          Similarly, a search query of `415 123` returns customers with the
          phone numbers `+1-212-415-1234` and

          `+1 (551) 234-1567` but not `+1-212-415-1200`. A match is found if a
          tokenized phone number contains all

          the tokens in the search query, irrespective of the token order.

          exact match between two strings, character by character in the given
          order.


          [Fuzzy
          matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#fuzzy-search-by-reference-id) 

          of stored reference IDs against queried reference IDs works 

          exactly the same as fuzzy matching on email addresses.
          Non-alphanumeric characters 

          are replaced by spaces to tokenize stored and queried reference IDs. A
          match is found

          if a tokenized stored reference ID contains all tokens specified in
          any order in the query. For example,

          a query of `NYC M` matches customer profiles with the `reference_id`
          value of `NYC_M_35_JOHNSON`

          and `NYC_27_MURRAY`.
      group_ids:
        type: optional<FilterValue>
        docs: >-
          A filter to select customers based on their group membership.


          The `group_ids` is a JSON object of the following general format:

          ```

          "group_ids": {

          "any":  ["{group_a_id}", "{group_b_id}", ...],

          "all":  ["{group_1_id}", "{group_2_id}", ...],

          "none": ["{group_i_id}", "{group_ii_id}", ...]

          }

          ```


          You can use any combination of these `group_ids` fields (also known as
          `FilterValue` properties) 

          to specify how customers are selected based on their group
          membership.  

          With the `any` option, the search returns customers in Groups `a` or
          `b` or ... of the list.

          With the `all` option, the search returns customers in Groups `1` and
          `2` and ... of the list.

          With the `none` option, the search returns customers not in Groups `i`
          and not in `ii` and not in ... of the list.


          If any of the search conditions are not met, including when an invalid
          or non-existent group ID is provided, the result is an empty list. 


          You can use the `group_ids` search filter with other available
          filters. 


          You cannot use the `group_ids` filter to select customers based on
          segment membership.
      custom_attribute:
        type: optional<CustomerCustomAttributeFilters>
        docs: >-
          A filter to select customers based on one or more custom attributes.  

          This filter can contain up to 10 custom attribute filters. Each custom
          attribute filter specifies filtering criteria for a target custom

          attribute. If multiple custom attribute filters are provided, they are
          combined as an `AND` operation.


          To be valid for a search, the custom attributes must be visible to the
          requesting application. For more information, including example
          queries,

          see [Search by custom
          attribute](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#search-by-custom-attribute).


          Square returns matching customer profiles, which do not contain custom
          attributes. To retrieve customer-related custom attributes,

          use the [Customer Custom Attributes
          API](api:CustomerCustomAttributes). For example, you can call

          [RetrieveCustomerCustomAttribute](api-endpoint:CustomerCustomAttributes-RetrieveCustomerCustomAttribute)
          using a customer ID from the result set.

          invoice based on the delivery

          method and payment request settings, either immediately or on the
          `scheduled_at` date, if specified.

          For example, Square might send the invoice or receipt for an automatic
          payment. For invoices with

          automatic payments, this field must be set to `EMAIL`.


          One of the following is required when creating an invoice:

          - (Recommended) This `delivery_method` field. To configure an
          automatic payment, the

          `automatic_payment_source` field of the payment request is also
          required.

          - The deprecated `request_method` field of the payment request. Note
          that `invoice`

          One of the following is required when creating an invoice:

          - (Recommended) The `delivery_method` field of the invoice. To
          configure an automatic payment, the

          `automatic_payment_source` field of the payment request is also
          required.

          - This `request_method` field. Note that `invoice` objects returned in

          - When the payment `request_type` is `INSTALLMENT`, it is the
          percentage of the order's total less 

          the deposit, if requested. The sum of the `percentage_requested` in
          all installment 

          payment requests must be equal to 100.


          You cannot specify this when the payment `request_type` is `BALANCE`

      Represents a snapshot of customer data. This object stores customer data
      that is displayed on the invoice 

      and that Square uses to deliver the invoice.


      When you provide a customer ID for a draft invoice, Square retrieves the
      associated customer profile and populates 

      the remaining `InvoiceRecipient` fields. You cannot update these fields
      after the invoice is published. 

      Square updates the customer ID in response to a merge operation, but does
      not update other fields.

      You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can
      filter

      for only one time range at a time.


      For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end
      time

      is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.


      __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,

      you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)

      to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT`
      field

      in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort`
      to

      `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

          __Important:__ When using a

          their `CLOSED_AT` date.

          If this field does not match the timestamp field in `DateTimeFilter`,

          `SearchOrders` returns an error.

          __IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any discounts in this
