        The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists

        the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most

        settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement

        entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual

        adjustments, or chargeback holds.


        Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the

        [Deposit Options with
        Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)

        help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available

        from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.


        Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only

        whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in

        a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may

        take longer.
