        Provides summary information for all payments taken for a given
        Square account during a date range. Date ranges cannot exceed 1 year in
        length. See Date ranges for details of inclusive and exclusive dates.

        *Note**: Details for payments processed with Square Point of Sale while
        in offline mode may not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours.
        Offline payments have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the
        payment was originally processed, not the time it was subsequently
        transmitted to Square. Consequently, the ListPayments endpoint might
        list an offline payment chronologically between online payments that
        were seen in a previous request.
