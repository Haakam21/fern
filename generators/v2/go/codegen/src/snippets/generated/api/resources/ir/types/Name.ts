 * The Go generator only needs access to the PascalCase naming convention.
 *
 * This represents a case where we could include a separate IR for each language
 * to reduce size. Alternatively, we could model everything as optional so the
 * same structure could be used for all languages, and the compiler could conditionally
 * set specific values based on the target language.
 *
 * Given that each language will need an IR, it probably makes sense to have a single one
 * that is shared across all languages. Otherwise there will be duplication between different
 * languages.
