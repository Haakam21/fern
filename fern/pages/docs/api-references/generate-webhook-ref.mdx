title: Generate your Webhook Reference
description: Use Fern Docs to generate your Webhook Reference documentation from your API definition, using your choice of either OpenAPI or Fern Definition.
---

Similar to API References, Fern Docs can automatically generate your Webhook Reference documentation from your API definition. Simply add `- webhook: Webhook Reference` to your navigation in `docs.yml` and Fern will generate comprehensive documentation for all your webhooks!

Example:

```yml docs.yml {9-10}
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: Getting Started
        path: ../introduction/getting-started.md
      - page: Authentication
        path: ../introduction/authentication.md
  - api: API Reference
    api-name: api-v1
    display-errors: true
  - webhook: Webhook Reference
    webhook-name: webhooks-v1
```

### Directory Structure
Your webhooks should be defined in a dedicated folder within your Fern project:

```
fern/
  └── apis/
      └── api/
          ├── webhooks/           # Webhook definition
          │   ├── openapi/       
          │   │   └── openapi.yml
          │   └── generators.yml
          └── api/               # Regular API endpoints
```

If you're using OpenAPI, your `generators.yml` file should point to your OpenAPI specification:

```yml generators.yml
api:
  path: openapi/openapi.yml
```

### OpenAPI Webhook Definition
To define a webhook in your OpenAPI specification, add the `x-fern-webhook: true` extension to your endpoint. OpenAPI 3.0.0 or higher is required. Here's a simplified example:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Example Webhooks
  version: "1.0"

paths:
  /payment-status:
    post:
      x-fern-webhook: true  # Indicates that this endpoint is a webhook
      tags:
        - Payment Webhooks
      summary: Payment Status Update
      description: Notifies you when a payment's status has been updated
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                eventType:
                  type: string
                  example: "PAYMENT.STATUS"
                payment:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: string
                    status:
                      type: string
                    amount:
                      type: number
```

### Include more than one Webhook Reference
To include multiple webhook definitions in your documentation, use the `webhook-name` property:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - webhook: Payment Webhooks
    webhook-name: payment-webhooks
  - webhook: Order Webhooks
    webhook-name: order-webhooks
```

When using multiple webhook definitions, organize them in separate directories within your Fern project:

```
fern/
  └── apis/
      └── api/
          ├── webhooks/
          │   ├── payment-webhooks/     # Payment webhook definitions
          │   │   ├── openapi/
          │   │   │   └── openapi.yml   # Payment webhook OpenAPI spec
          │   │   └── generators.yml
          │   └── order-webhooks/       # Order webhook definitions
          │       ├── openapi/
          │       │   └── openapi.yml   # Order webhook OpenAPI spec
          │       └── generators.yml
          └── api/                      # Regular API endpoints
```
