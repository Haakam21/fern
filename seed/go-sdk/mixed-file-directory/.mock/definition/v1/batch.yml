        Bundle multiple requests to Connect V1 API endpoints as a single

        request.



        The __V1SubmitBatch__ endpoint does not require an access token

        in the request header. Instead, provide an `access_token` parameter for

        each request included in the batch.


        __V1SubmitBatch__ responds with an array that contains response objects
        for

        each of the batched requests. There is no guarantee of the order in

        which batched requests are performed.



        __IMPORTANT__


        You cannot include more than 30 requests in a single batch and

        recursive requests to __V1SubmitBatch__ are not allowed. In

        other words, none of the requests included in a batch can itself be a

        request to the __V1SubmitBatch__ endpoint.
